reservation sustem is not responsive enough, if a user selects a time where a specific zone is reserved, then changes time where that zone is available, he still cant select it, even tho it is not greyed out anymore.

Limit the time when you can create a reservation. Cant make reservations after 21:00 local time (Riga). Basically can be made only during working hours.
Add info that reservations can be amde only during that time.

Send some form of notification to an admin email that a reservation has been made, Ideally whatsapp or sms, worst case email.

change the available times from admin panel (basically working hours.)
